# Task: Separate Code into Frontend and Backend

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Create 'frontend' and 'backend' directories in the root.
- [x] Move the entire 'pages' directory into 'frontend/pages' to house all frontend code (React components, layout, and data files).
- [x] Leave 'backend' directory empty as no backend code is present.
- [x] Check and update any import paths in moved files if necessary (e.g., in layout.js, the '@/api/base44Client' import may need adjustment based on new structure).
- [x] Verify the new directory structure and ensure no broken references.
